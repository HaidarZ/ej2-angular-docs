# Npm package in Angular component

Starting with v18.4.0.30 (Volume 4, 2020), the Syncfusion Angular UI components are separately available in individual [NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40syncfusion%2Fej2-angular). The NPM packages are segregated based on the component usage and its namespace.
