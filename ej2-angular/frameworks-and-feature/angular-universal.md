# Angular universal in Angular Frameworks and feature component

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
Angular is a client-side web development framework. On the contrary, conventional web technologies such as Asp.Net WebForms and Asp.Net MVC, etc.. are server-side frameworks. So, most of the web tools are designed by keeping these conventional web technologies in mind.

This pushes the Angular to support server-side rendering, which is called the 'Angular Universal', in line with other conventional technologies.

## Syncfusion Angular UI Components in Angular Universal

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
Syncfusion Angular UI Components also supports the Angular Universal. The [Universal-Starter](https://github.com/angular/universal-starter) will help us to create a Universal application without any hassle.

* Download/clone the starter project in the local machine.
* Install the required Syncfusion component packages such as `npm install @syncfusion/ej2-buttons --save`
* Import the installed modules in `app.module.ts` file.
* Import the required component in `app.component.ts` file along with its code changes.
* Build and serve the application in both prerender and rerender(ssr) mode of the universal.
