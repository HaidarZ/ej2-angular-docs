# Accordion tree in Angular Treeview component

Accordion is an interface where a list of items can be collapsed or expanded, but only one list can be collapsed or expanded at a time. You can customize the TreeView to make it behave as an accordion. Refer to the following code sample to create an accordion tree.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.component.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-view/accordion-tree-cs1/app/app.component.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.module.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-view/accordion-tree-cs1/app/app.module.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="main.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-view/accordion-tree-cs1/app/main.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
