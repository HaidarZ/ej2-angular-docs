# Getting Started

Initialize the Spinner using `createSpinner` method and show/hide the spinner using `showSpinner` and `hideSpinner` methods accordingly. Set the target to the spinner to render it based on specific target.

```typescript
  createSpinner({
    target: document.getElementById('container')
  });
```

* Show and hide this spinner by using `showSpinner` and `hideSpinner` methods for loading in your page.
