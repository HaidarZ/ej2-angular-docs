# Licensing FAQ

## How to upgrade from Trial version after purchasing a license

To upgrade from trial version, there are two possible solutions.

* Uninstall the trial version and install the fully licensed build from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website.

* If you are using Syncfusion controls from [nuget.org](http://172.16.0.76/aspnet-core/licensing/licensing-faq/(https:/www.nuget.org/packages?q=syncfusion)), replace the currently used trial license key with a paid license key that can be generated from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website. Refer to [this](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key#how-to-register-the-syncfusion-license-key) topic for more information regarding registering the license in the application.

>**NOTE** <br /> License registration is not required if you reference Syncfusion assemblies from Licensed installer. These licensing changes applicable to all evaluators who refers the Syncfusion assemblies from evaluation installer and those who use Syncfusion NuGet packages form [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/)

## Where can I get a License key

License keys can be generated from the [License & Downloads](https://syncfusion.com/account/downloads) or [Trial & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials/downloads) section of the Syncfusion website.

Syncfusion license keys are **version and platform specific**, refer to the [KB](https://www.syncfusion.com/kb/8976/how-to-generate-license-key-for-licensed-products) to generate the license key for the required version and platform. Also, refer this [KB](https://www.syncfusion.com/kb/8951/which-version-syncfusion-license-key-should-i-use-in-my-application) to know about which version of the Syncfusion license key should be used in the application.

## Registering Syncfusion account for direct NuGet.org user

If you have directly obtained Syncfusion assemblies from [NuGet.org](http://nuget.org/) and do not have a Syncfusion account, follow the steps to obtain a free 30-day trial license key:

* Register for a free Syncfusion account [here](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/register).

* Go to the start trials [page](https://syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials/start-trials) and start a trial.

* Finally proceed to the [Trials & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials/downloads) section to obtain the [license key](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/licensing/generating-license-keys).
