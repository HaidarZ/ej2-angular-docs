# Overview

The ComboBox control allows the user to type a value or choose an option from the list of predefined options.
When an arrow icon accompanied with this control is pressed, the dropdown displays a list of values, from which the user can select one.

## Key features

* **[Data binding](./data-binding/)** - Allows binding and accessing the list of items from local or server-side data source.

* **[Custom values](./getting-started/#custom-values)** - Allows setting user-defined values that is not in the popup list.

* **[Grouping](./grouping/)** - Supports grouping of logically related items under a single or specific category.

* **[Filtering](./filtering/)** - Allows filtering of list items based on a character typed in the control.

* **[Templates](./templates/)** - Allows customizing the list items, selected value, header, footer, category group header, and no records content.
