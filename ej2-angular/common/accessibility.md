# Accessibility in Syncfusion Angular Components

Accessibility in components refers to the practice of designing and building user interface elements in a way that makes them accessible to users with disabilities. This can include a variety of things, such as making sure that text is high contrast and easy to read, providing alternative text for images, and designing controls and interactions that can be used with a keyboard or assistive technology.

## Accessibility compliance

Accessibility compliance refers to the extent to which a product, device, service, or environment meets certain standards or guidelines for accessibility. These standards and guidelines may be set by governments, industry organizations, or other groups.

Syncfusion Angular components meet the following guidelines and standards that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility:
* [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/) - Law to ensure that people with disabilities have the same opportunities and access as people without disabilities.

* [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) - Provides guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). WAI-ARIA provides a set of roles, states, and properties that can be added to HTML elements to provide additional context and information about the purpose and behavior of those elements. This can help assistive technologies better understand and interpret web content and interact with web applications.

* [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) - Syncfusion Angular components compliance with the standard of `section 508` accessibility. The `section 508` standards are a set of guidelines for making electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to people with disabilities. These standards apply to federal agencies in the United States, and they are based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

## Screen reader

A screen reader allows people who are blind or visually impaired to use a computer by reading aloud the text that is displayed on the screen. Syncfusion Angular components meet the standards defined in the common screen reader such as [JAW](https://www.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS), Narrator, Lighthouse and Accessibility insights.

## Accessibility testing

The goal of accessibility testing is to identify and address any barriers that might prevent individuals with disabilities from using the product or service effectively. There are several different types of accessibility testing that can be performed on Syncfusion Angular components, such as:

* `Automated testing`: Syncfusion Angular components accessibility levels are ensured through software tools such as accessibility checkers and Jasmin test cases.

* `Manual testing`: This type of testing involves manually evaluating the Syncfusion Angular components. During manual accessibility testing, testers will ensure accessibility using screen readers.

## Keyboard navigation

Keyboard navigation refers to the ability to use a keyboard to interact with and navigate through a user interface. It is an important aspect of web accessibility, as it allows people who cannot use a mouse or other pointing device to access and use web content and applications.

Syncfusion Angular components support keyboard navigation, which allows users to interact with the components using the keyboard shortcuts. Check out the corresponding component's document to learn more about the details of the keyboard navigation. Refer to the following documents to get the details of top components.
