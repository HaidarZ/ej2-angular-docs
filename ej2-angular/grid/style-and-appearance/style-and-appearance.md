# Style and appearance in Angular Grid component

To modify the Grid appearance, you need to override the default CSS of grid. Please find the CSS structure that can be used to modify the Grid appearance. Also, you have an option to create your own custom theme for all the JavaScript controls using our [`Theme Studio`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/themestudio/?theme=material).

## Customizing the Grid root element

Use the below CSS to customize the Grid root element.

```css

.e-grid {
      font-family: cursive;
}

```
